A feature which allows co-enrollment allows a client to be enrolled in any number of experiments/rollouts for that feature. 

**Features supporting co-enrollment**

* Messaging (Fenix, Firefox iOS, Focus for Android, Focus for iOS)

# How to define a co-enrolling feature

A feature can be marked as allowing co-enrollment with a boolean flag in its feature definition in a Feature Manifest. For example, in your `messaging.fml.yaml` file:

```yaml
features:
  messaging:
    description: |
      The in-app messaging system.
    allow-coenrollment: true
    variables:
      messages:
        description: A growable collection of messages
        type: Map<String, MessageData>
        default: {}
```

Once your messaging feature is defined as a co-enrolling feature, a client can be enrolled in any number of messaging experiments/rollouts.

Other things to note: 
* Experiment feature values still take precedence over rollout feature values
* Enrollment/unenrollment is calculated independently for each experiment/rollout regardless of whether they target the same feature or not
* Enrollment/unenrollment telemetry is still sent for each experiment/rollout at the time each enrolls or unenrolls
