### Question

What's the difference between "Experimenter" and "Nimbus"?

### Answer

Nimbus is the code name of the experimentation project, so Nimbus refers to **the whole experimentation system** (handles enrolling/unenrolling users, sending branch configurations, etc). Experimenter is the **customer interface to both Nimbus and Jetstream** that you access at http://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/. In Experimenter, users can configure experiments, manage them (launch, monitor, end), and can see the results.
