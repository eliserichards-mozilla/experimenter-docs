### Question
As a mobile engineer, how do I add a dot release version?

### Answer
* Add a new `Version` to the [constants.py file](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/experimenter/experimenter/experiments/constants.py) in Experimenter 
* Run `make generate_types` to generate the new version in `schema.graphql` and `globalTypes.ts`
