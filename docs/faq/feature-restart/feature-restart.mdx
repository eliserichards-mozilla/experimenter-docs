### Question
Is feature restart supported?

### Answer

Yes! Feature restart is supported by Nimbus. This is how it works when a feature requires a restart:
* **Session 1:** Client enrolls, applies feature configuration, but the feature itself won't implement the changes until the next restart
* **Session 2:** Client is enrolled, feature configuration is applied, feature now shows changes

:::tip Important
Please share that this experiment needs a restart in your data science Jira ticket and that there is custom work needed at analysis to exlude the pre-restart data.
