### Question
What do I do if feature metrics aren't there?

Watch [this video](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7f677cde-3b61-4cd5-8119-af7b013c7579) to know how metrics work with experiments.  The video covers the steps below. These details are provided here for ease of reference and links.
:::

After completing your experiment brief and defining your learning goals - attend an office hours to discuss how you could measure the changes.  Based on that discussion - go through the steps below until the metrics needed for this experiment are covered.  You do not need to complete all the steps - just enough to answer your questions.

**Step 1** - Check  [here](/deep-dives/jetstream/metrics#how-do-i-add-a-metric-to-my-experiment) to learn if the existing Guardrail/Core metrics or Outcomes will answer your questions.

**Step 2** - Did an experiment run previously had these metrics you need?  
* Look at previous experiments in your feature area - do those metrics meet your needs?  Re-using metrics is a much quicker than writing custom metrics from scratch.   
* If yes, create a [DO Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269) including:  
  * the link to your current experiment 
  * the link to the previous experiment(s) results.  Specify the metrics from the previous experiment you are interested in and how they answer your question.    
* BEST PRACTICE: If you want these metrics for future experiments on this feature - ask to have an Outcome added instead of a custom config file.  Adding an Outcome means these metrics will be available to select from the Outcome drop down in Metrics for future experiments.  

**Step 3** - Provide information to create a custom metric for this experiment.
* Create a [DO Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269) including: 
  * the link to your current experiment  
  * the questions you need to answer about the feature (that aren't covered by metrics from step 1 or step 2)
  * the specific telemetry probes in your feature that will be used to answer the question - including the possible values those probes collect and when they are sent. 
* A data scientist will work with feature product and engineering to create a custom jetstream config file to add these metrics.  Provided the telemetry probes exist and are testing - the custom configuration file can be written after experiment launch (before end) and applied.
