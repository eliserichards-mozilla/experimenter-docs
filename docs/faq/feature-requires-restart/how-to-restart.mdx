This is how it works when a feature requires a restart:
* Session 1: Client enrolls, applies feature configuration, but the feature itself won't implement the changes until the next restart
* Session 2: Client is enrolled, feature configuration is applied, feature now shows changes

IMPORTANT:  Please share that this experiment needs a restart in your data science Jira ticket and that there is custom work needed at analysis to exlude the pre-restart data.
