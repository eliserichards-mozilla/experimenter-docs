### Question
Is the "exposure event" the default way to use all the automation to exclude the first session? Or is manual exclusion of the first session in analysis the only way?

### Answer
Manual exclusion in analysis is the way. Exposures tell us which users saw the treatment, but we just use that as an indicator, we donâ€™t automatically filter the data after the exposure event, so it has to be manual.
