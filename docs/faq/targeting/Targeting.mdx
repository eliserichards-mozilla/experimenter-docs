### Question
Can Nimbus experiments/rollouts target specific beta releases, 
ie can I express "roll this out to everyone on 104b6 and later"?*

### Answer
**Yes.** File an issue [here](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/issues/new) to add a specific version (of beta, nightly, or release) and then ping in [`#ask-experimenter`](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/CF94YGE03) on Slack.  


The version requested will get added as an option to the Minimum Version and Maximum Version drop down menues. It is a minor and quick change. By default Experimenter (Nimbus) only exposes the whole valued versions, until requested.
