The commands that open the app do so by simulating the app's launch as if the user tapped on the app icon on the phone; these are:

- `enroll`
- `unenroll`
- `test-feature`
- `apply-file`
- `log-state`
- `open`.

In addition, the `enroll`, `open` and `test-feature` commands, can launch the app with a deeplink.

## Deeplinking

`nimbus-cli` knows the apps' deeplinking schemes, and if no `://` is detected in the deeplink, then the deeplink scheme is appended.

### `open`

For example:

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open
```

launches the app with `simctl`:

```sh
$ xcrun simctl launch \
        booted \
        org.mozilla.ios.Fennec \
        --nimbus-cli \
        --version \
        1
```

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open --deeplink deep-link?url=settings/general
```

opens the deeplink (i.e. not sending directly to the app) with:

```sh
$ xcrun simctl openurl \
        booted \
        fennec://deep-link?url=settings/general
```

By default, each of the commands that launches the app also kills the app right before; with the `open` command you can send the app a deeplink without killing it, using the `--no-clobber` property.

```
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer enroll ios-set-to-default-in-onboarding-final --branch treatment-a
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open --deeplink deep-link?url=onboarding/privacy-first --no-clobber
```

#### Deeplinks for other commands:

> iOS `simctl` does not support command line arguments with the `openurl` command. Opening with a deeplink while enrolling in an experiment is not supported.

### `enroll`

For Android, opening a deeplink uses the same mechanism as launching the app: using Intents. Thus, we can enroll in an experiment and then open the app with a deeplink.

```sh
nimbus-cli --app fenix --channel developer enroll release-android-onboarding-redesign --branch treatment-a --deeplink onboarding/privacy-first
```

### `test-feature`

Similarly, you can use a `--deeplink` to enroll a [`test-feature`](/nimbus-cli/working-with-features) experiment.

## Terminating and Resetting the app

`open`, `enroll` and `test-feature` all support a `--reset-app` option, which serves to reset the app back to its just-installed state before opening.

## Passthrough parameters

Opening apps with `nimbus-cli` provides an abstraction over `adb shell start am` and `xcrun simctl launch`.

Passthrough parameters offer a small escape hatch from this abstraction.

### Trailing parameters for apps

You may want to send additional command line parameters to these commands. You can do this by appending them with `--` after the `open`, `enroll`, or `test-feature` commands:

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open --reset-app -- FIREFOX_TEST FIREFOX_SKIP_INTRO
```

This produces an `xcrun` command:

```sh
$ xcrun simctl launch \
        booted \
        org.mozilla.ios.Fennec \
        FIREFOX_TEST \
        FIREFOX_SKIP_INTRO
```

These are entirely app specific. e.g. Firefox for iOS has the launch parameters available in [`LaunchArguments.swift`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/main/Shared/LaunchArguments.swift).

For Android apps, you can modify the intent being sent to the device with [intent arguments](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#IntentSpec). The most saliant are reproduced here:

| Extra parameters | Description |
| - | - |
| `--esn extra_key` | Add a null extra. This option is not supported for URI intents. |
| `--es extra_key extra_string_value` | Add string data as a key-value pair. |
| `--ez extra_key extra_boolean_value` |  Add boolean data as a key-value pair. |
| `--ei extra_key extra_int_value` | Add integer data as a key-value pair. |
| `--el extra_key extra_long_value` |  Add long data as a key-value pair. |

For a fictional example:

```sh
nimbus-cli --app fenix --channel developer open --reset-app -- --esn SKIP_INTRO
```

produces an `adb` command:

```sh
$ adb shell "am start -n org.mozilla.fenix.debug/.App \
        -a android.intent.action.MAIN \
        -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER \
        --esn \
        SKIP_INTRO"
```

### Leading parameters

For finer control of `xcrun` and `adb`, you can use `{}` as a positional indicator:

For example, to enable debugging, you need to pass the `-D` parameter:

```sh
nimbus-cli --app fenix --channel developer open -- -D {}
```

This produces an `adb` command:

```sh
 adb shell "am start -D \
        -n org.mozilla.fenix.debug/.App \
        -a android.intent.action.MAIN \
        -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"
```

Leading and trailing parameters can be combined, and used with any combination of `open`, `test-feature` and `enroll`.

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer \
        enroll ios-search-bar-placement-v2-treatment-a-rollout --branch treatment-a \
        -- \
        --console-pty {} FIREFOX_SKIP_INTRO
```

#### Platform specific passthrough parameters

Leading parameters are platform specific:

`adb shell am` can be configured with:

- `-D`: Enable debugging.
- `-W`: Wait for launch to complete.
- `--start-profiler file`: Start profiler and send results to `file`.
- `-P file`: Like `--start-profiler`, but profiling stops when the app goes idle.
- `-R count`: Repeat the activity launch `count` times. Prior to each repeat, the top activity will be finished.
- `-S`: Force stop the target app before starting the activity.
- `--opengl-trace`: Enable tracing of OpenGL functions.
- `--user user_id | current`: Specify which user to run as; if not specified, then run as the current user.

`xcrun simctl launch` can be configured with:

- `--console` Block and print the application's stdout and stderr to the current terminal.
		Signals received by simctl are passed through to the application.
		(Cannot be combined with --stdout or --stderr)
- `--console-pty` Block and print the application's stdout and stderr to the current terminal via a PTY.
		Signals received by simctl are passed through to the application.
		(Cannot be combined with --stdout or --stderr)
- `--stdout=<path>` Redirect the application's standard output to a file.
- `--stderr=<path>` Redirect the application's standard error to a file.
- `--terminate-running-process` Terminate any running copy of the application.
		Note: Log output is often directed to stderr, not stdout.
