### Feature Manifest Language errors (mobile only)

:::

For non-desktop applications, the Feature Manifest Language (FML) is used to surface errors when we are configuring our branches. This is particularly helpful for deeply nested features, which can be difficult to configure on the Branches page.

You can see that the save button validation has given us usable FML errors, including the line/col number that the error occurs at:

<img title="FML Version error" src="/img/deep-dives/fml-version-error.png"/>

The FML generates errors based on the **feature** you are using, the **application**, the **versions** of the application that you are targeting, and the **channel**. Changing the channel on your experiment may result in different FML errors, since there may be differences between the feature manifests for each version and channel.


## Desktop

When configuring your branches for a desktop experiment, you will see **autocomplete** as you type, as well as **JSON linting**. FML errors are not present on desktop, since desktop does not use the Feature Manifest Language.
