# Rollouts

> üí°  Note: this feature is still in progress. See "Future work".

Rollouts are single-branch experiments that differ from a traditional experiment in a number of ways.

## When should I use a rollout instead of an experiment?

When I have a ‚Äúwinning branch‚Äù from an in-flight experiment, I want to easily set some percentage of the non-experiment population to that feature configuration. To create a rollout from an experiment, the experiment is cloned and a new rollout is created. Through this clone, the population percentage can be changed. Additionally, a rollout can be manually created (without cloning) through the "Create new" button on the Nimbus home screen. To mark the new item as a rollout, check the "This is a rollout" box on the "Branches" page:

A rollout is different from an experiment in that the population size can be scaled up and down (even set all the way to zero) with no analytical repurcussions. Even if a rollout is set to have a population size of zero (essentially turning the feature "off"), the rollout may be edited again to increase the population size. Likewise, if the rollout is "fully rolled out" to 100% of the population, it may still be edited.

## Features

### Interactions

- When configuring the audience for a rollout of a given feature, I should see information about all live experiments/rollouts of the same feature so I clearly understand how that will impact my population sizing.
  This can be done by filtering on the home screen by the given feature. All experiments/rollouts that have been created for that feature will appear in the filtered list.

### Directory view

- I should to view all live experiments and rollouts for a given feature.
  From the Nimbus home screen, all rollouts and experiments are viewable. There is no specific filtering to allow only rollouts at this time (see "Future work", separation of concerns).

## Supported platforms and minimum version targeting

Experimenter currently supports the following platforms:

- Desktop
- Fenix (Firefox for Android)
- Focus Android
- Firefox iOS
- Focus iOS

The minimum version supported for rollouts on all platforms (listed above) is currently 105. See [Experimenter](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/experiments/constants.py#L370) for more details.

## Future work

- Live editability for rollouts
- Differentiate opt-out support for experiments vs rollouts
- Separation of concerns: separating experiment and rollout state

### Interactions

- I want to be able to create new experiments or update my rollout population without having to launch in a particular order to avoid unwanted interactions on the client.

### Ramping

- When I need to increase or decrease the population percentage of a rollout configuration, I want to do this without creating a new rollout instance.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è  Unimplemented

  Currently, a rollout is created using the same workflow as an experiment (Nimbus home -> Create new -> ‚úÖ   This is a rollout). The population percentage is defined at create time, and is not editable while live (see "Future work").

- When increasing/decreasing the population percentage, I should be able to request a review and approve/reject via the experimenter UI.

### Directory view

- I should be able to differentiate between experiments and rollouts when looking at a directory listing.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è  Unimplemented

  Rollouts are not differentiated on the main home page. When creating a new rollout, you can see the "Rollout" tag added next to the experiment name. Behind the scenes, rollouts are differentiated from experiments by their bucket prefix.

### Automated analysis

- The dashboards for rollouts that OpMon generates follow this URL pattern:
