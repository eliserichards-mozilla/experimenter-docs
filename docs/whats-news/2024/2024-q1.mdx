🛎️ Subscribe to notifications

   > Non-owners can now [subscribe to notifications](/notifications). Previously, these notifications were only being sent to experiment owners. This feature is available for all users and all experiments, and can be found in the Overview section on the Summary page of an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4229](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4229)

🛠️ Audience overlap

   > We now have warnings on Experimenter for three known cases of audience overlap. [These warnings](/faq/warnings] will prevent detectable cases of audience overlap, which generally result in under enrollment and can invalidate an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4180](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4180))
