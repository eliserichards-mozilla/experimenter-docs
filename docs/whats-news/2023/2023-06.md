# What's New in Nimbus - Q2 2023

## The `nimbus-cli`

The `nimbus-cli` was conceived at the team's Q2 workweek. It is designed to help QA engineers test mobile first run experiments, but has become a tool useful for interacting, inspecting and testing all experiments running on the supported mobile apps, and any feature that those apps configure via Nimbus.

Installation is:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/application-services/main/install-nimbus-cli.sh | bash
```

and further details are at [https://experimenter.info/nimbus-cli](/nimbus-cli).

## Jetstream

### Computing the date for expected results
We are now computing the date that the Jetstream results will be available for a given experiment. This new value is based on enrollment end date (or proposed enrollment end date if enrollment is not yet ended).

## Experimenter

### Release date for First Run experiments

Our approach for calculating dates and duration for experiments did not previously take the release trains into account. For example, a first run experiment targeting Firefox desktop v123 might be launched (status=Live) on 1/2/2023. However, v123 might not be released until 1/15/2023. The start_date for this experiment will therefore be 1/2/2023, but users will not start seeing it until 1/15 when the version is released. 

We added another date, "proposed release date" or "first run release date", for first-run mobile experiments which will represent the [release date of the browser version](http://whattrainisitnow.com/) that is being targeted by the user. 

This date gives us the ability to:
* Correctly compute enrollment and proposed end dates based on when users will actually start getting the release version
* Send reminder emails to experiment owners at the right time so that they can end enrollment/end experiments

This new field shows up on the Audience page of the experiment, and is also viewable on the Summary page and on the timeline:
