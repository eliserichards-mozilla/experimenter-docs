# What's New in Nimbus - Q2 2023

## The `nimbus-cli`

The `nimbus-cli` was conceived at the team's Q2 workweek. It is designed to help QA engineers test mobile first run experiments, but has become a tool useful for interacting, inspecting and testing all experiments running on the supported mobile apps, and any feature that those apps configure via Nimbus.

Installation is:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/application-services/main/install-nimbus-cli.sh | bash
```

and further details are at [https://experimenter.info/nimbus-cli](/nimbus-cli).

## Jetstream

### Computing the date for expected results
We are now computing the date that the Jetstream results will be available for a given experiment. This new value is based on enrollment end date (or proposed enrollment end date if enrollment is not yet ended).
