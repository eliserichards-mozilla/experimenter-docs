# What's New in Nimbus March 2023

### Rollouts
Nimbus now supports edits for live rollouts! This allows owners to make changes to the population percentage and publish them. See our [rollouts deep-dive](/deep-dives/experimenter/rollouts) for more info!

### Nimbus Gradle Plugin
The Nimbus gradle plugin has been moved from Android Components to Application Services. Updated information for utilizing the plugin can be found [here](/getting-started/engineers/getting-started-for-android-engineers).

### Testing tooling
For injecting experimental feature configurations for integration tests, we now have the following:
 * Added a `malformedConfiguration` event for app features to report bad configurations.
 * Added a `record_past_event` method to test display triggers based on the event store.

### Messaging
Weâ€™re in the last stretch of QA for adding a notification surface to the Nimbus Messaging system on Android (thank you @twhite and @mheres). For iOS, the survey surface has landed (thank you to @yrios and @roux).

### More exciting changes coming next month!
